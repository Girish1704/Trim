# Manufacturing – Visual Assistant with Generative AI (GenAI)
*Build an AI-powered visual inspection assistant to detect defects, analyze images, and generate actionable insights using Azure AI Vision and Generative AI.*

**Duration:** 6 hours  

**Tags:** `Manufacturing`, `Generative AI`, `Computer Vision`, `Azure AI`, `Quality Control`

## Overview
In this lab, participants will learn how to combine **Azure AI Vision** with **Generative AI** to create a **Visual Assistant** capable of analyzing manufacturing images for defects or anomalies and generating natural-language explanations.  
You will build a lightweight workflow that processes sample images, detects issues, and uses a large language model to generate inspection summaries and corrective recommendations.

The goal is to demonstrate how GenAI can enhance human inspection tasks, improve quality control efficiency, and enable data-driven manufacturing insights.

## Problem Statement
Production lines in manufacturing frequently rely on visual inspections for defects, deviations, or maintenance issues (e.g., component misalignment, surface blemishes, missing parts). Manual visual review is time-consuming, inconsistent, and difficult to scale. Teams often struggle with using images or videos from cameras, identifying issues quickly, documenting them, and routing these insights for action. This slows throughput, increases scrap/rework, and limits real-time decision making.

## Solution Overview

Provide a beginner-friendly prototype where teams build a “visual assistant” that uses generative AI + computer-vision to assist shop-floor operators. The assistant ingests images or video frames from a manufacturing line (or sample dataset), analyses them for anomalies (defects, misalignment, missing parts), generates natural-language commentary (e.g., “Component X appears misaligned by approx 3mm; recommend repositioning”), and presents a simple UI dashboard for review and action. By combining vision models + generative AI commentary, the lab allows teams to show how manufacturing visual inspection and assistance can be automated and augmented.

## Learning Objectives
**Description:**  
By the end of this lab, you will learn to:

- Understand how to combine computer vision (image/frame ingestion) with generative AI to produce commentary and recommended actions.
- Pre-process visual data (images/frames), detect anomalies/defects, and use retrieval/prompting pipelines to generate natural-language insights.
- Build a simple UI or dashboard that shows visual input, detected issues, commentary and next-steps.
- Recognise challenges: camera calibration, lighting, anomaly-detection false positives, generative AI hallucination, human-in-loop review.
- Learn how to deploy a lightweight prototype using accessible Azure (or cloud) services and clean up resources.


## Challenges Overview

- **Challenge 01: Create Azure AI Vision Resource**  
Provision the Azure AI Vision service in the Azure Portal to perform image analysis on manufacturing components.

- **Challenge 02: Upload and Analyze Sample Manufacturing Images**  
Upload synthetic manufacturing images to Azure Blob Storage and analyze them using the AI Vision service to detect objects and potential anomalies.

- **Challenge 03: Deploy Azure OpenAI Service for Commentary Generation**  
Deploy the Azure OpenAI Service and use the gpt-35-turbo model to generate text-based commentary from the detected visual results.

- **Challenge 04: Generate Visual Inspection Reports**  
Combine AI Vision and Generative AI outputs to produce comprehensive visual inspection summaries highlighting detected issues and recommendations.

- **Challenge 05: Build a Visual Assistant Web Interface**  
Create a simple Streamlit-based dashboard to upload images, view AI results, and interact with Generative AI commentary in real-time.

- **Challenge 06: Clean Up Resources**  
Remove all Azure resources to prevent extra costs and complete your Visual Assistant workflow.
