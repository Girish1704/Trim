## Conclusion

This streamlined lab structure delivers comprehensive hands-on experience with Azure AI Foundry and agent development within a 2 hour timeframe. By focusing on essential components of AI agent creation—environment setup, authentication, chat completions, RAG implementation, and specialized agent development—participants gain practical skills immediately applicable to real-world AI projects.

The removed exercises (Exercise 5: Observability and Exercise 6: Multi-Agent RAG) represent advanced topics that require strong foundational understanding. These are better suited for follow-up workshops where participants have mastered basic agent development patterns.

Participants completing this streamlined lab will have functional AI agents capable of:
- Conversational interactions with contextual understanding
- Code execution for calculations and data visualization
- Retrieval-augmented generation for context-aware responses
